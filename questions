Hi, in first place, your development was very useful, thank you. 

My publish is to share a doubt, I want to perform a logout in a certain point in my application but, the application is stil keeping the
cookies created with the authentication info. When a request is made to the application, if this cookie exists, the application does't need
to send anything to the adfs server and therefor, will not know that it may need to update its authentication info. What i mean is, the adfs 
server may recieve a logout but, the application keeps the cookie. My questions is, how to make sure the cookie is deleted?
Have you experienced any problem with the logout?
Thank you
